    </li>
     <li>His pseudonym for his literature-related work was Fuyuhiko Yoshimura.He is best known for his numerous essays on a wide variety of topics ranging from science to manga.
    </li>
     <li>Torahiko Terada was born in 1878 in the Tokyo Kojimachi District. He was named "Torahiko" because he was born under the Year of the Tiger. 
    </li>
     <li>While in high school in Kumamoto, the young Torahiko studied under Natsume Sōseki and science teacher Takuro Tamaru. It was the influence of both men whom Terada attributed his inspiration to seriously pursue studies of science and literature during the course of his life.
    </li>
      <li>In 1897, Terada met and courted student Natsuko Sakai, who was to become his first wife. He continued his studies and in 1899,[1] earned his PhD at the Tokyo Imperial University.
    </li>
   <li>He really didn’t like socks, and usually didn’t wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, he bragged about getting away “without wearing socks” while at Oxford.
    </li>
   <li>He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn’t known until the 1980s, but according to correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieserl. At one point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.
    </li>
   <li>His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain without permission. He eventually got the permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was fired from Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over forty years before finally returning it in 1998.
