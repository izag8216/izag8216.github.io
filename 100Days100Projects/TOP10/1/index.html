              Originally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he
              was ultimately dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to
              China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic
              Buddhism. He remained there for five years, finally training under
              Tiantong Rujing, an eminent teacher of the Chinese Caodong
              lineage. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the practice
              of zazen (sitting meditation) through literary works such as Fukan
              zazengi and Bendōwa.
